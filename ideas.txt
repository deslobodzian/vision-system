Improve Logger:
    * Log to file that can handle crashes and sudden interrupts 
    * Async Logging
    * Remove Log level flag to be runtime not compile time set maybe as parameter

Need frontend for configuration and viewing of camera input and output
    * find a framework that will work well, websocket preferred
